Write a high-level **script for a Black Mirror episode** (or any similar sci-fi show that deals with implications of technology) or a **short story**:
 
-  The script/story should engage with any of the issues we discussed in class (or other issues related to technology)
-  Show complexity of the issue (i.e. trade-offs between privacy & security)
-  It is helpful to start your writing process with the issue of interest, which will lead you to the specific technology. Not the other way around.
-  	At least 3 pages (single-spaced).-	At most 5 pages (excluding the explanatory paragraph below).-	After the script/story, in a separate paragraph, include a brief explanation of which competing values you were trying to highlight (i.e. privacy vs. security).

Optional readings to help you with the final project:

## Syllabus Details

Society is continuously challenged by new advances, inventions, and the social and ethical repercussions of technology.

This class explores these issues, from the perspective of technology policy, design, and potential impilications for the lived experiences of the technology users. Throughout the course we will cover privacy, intellectual property, issues of digital divide, algorithmic bias, professional responsibility and codes, online communities, chatbots, and the social and legal impacts of these and other technologies.

### Assignments
Every week you will have to turn in a one-page <span style="color:orange">single-spaced</span> written essay. These should be turned in, printed out, each week in class. Based on the weeks reading, please discuss the following:

* What are the multiple competing values or points of view present in the readings (i.e. freedom of speech, censorship, and privacy in the right to be forgotten [PBS Idea Chanel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD37vwUD8Us))?
* What are the current social implications of this technology or situation – how is it affecting people now?
* What are the possible future implications – where do you imagine this going and how would it affect our society then? 

### Expectations
You are expect to attend class, to have completed the assigned readings, and to participate in class discussion. Missing class will result in lower grade. You are expected to be respectful of the opinion of others during discussion. All assignments should be done individually. 

### Grades
* Attendance – 10%
* Class discussion – 30%
* Short weekly assignments – 40%
* Final project – 20%

The course materials are largely based on Casey Fiesler's [Ethical and Policy Dimensions of Information, Technology, and New Media course](https://informationethicspolicy.wordpress.com/) and the course description builds on Patrick Kelly's [earlier iteration of this course](http://cs.unm.edu/~pgk/293f15/).
