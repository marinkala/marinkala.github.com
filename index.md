I'm an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).

My research interests are in Crisis Informatics, Social Computing, and Network Science. Specifically, I study how people coordinate, self-organize, collectively problem-solve, and form communities online, especially in the high-tempo, high-risk environment of crisis. More broadly, I am interested in how social media platforms — as both complex and sociotechnical systems — affect and are affected by social behavior.

I completed my PhD in [Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://colorado.edu) in [Human Centered Computing](http://hcc.colorado.edu) under the advisement of Professor [Leysia Palen](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/). Then I spent a year and a half as an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.unm.edu/) at [University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu/).

Before developing my interdisciplinary focus, I studied Sociology at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) and worked as STEM education researcher at [Ethnography & Evaluation Research](http://www.colorado.edu/eer/).

I am currently supervising following PhD students:
