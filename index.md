I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu).

My research interests are in Crisis Informatics, Social Computing, and Network Science. Specifically, I study how people coordinate, self-organize, collectively problem-solve, and form communities online, especially in the high-tempo, high-risk environment of crisis. More broadly, I am interested in how social media platforms — as both complex and sociotechnical systems — affect and are affected by social behavior.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://colorado.edu) in [Human Centered Computing](http://hcc.colorado.edu) under the advisement of Professor [Leysia Palen](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/).

Before developing my interdisciplinary focus, I studied Sociology at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) and worked as social science researcher at [Ethnography & Evaluation Research](http://www.colorado.edu/eer/).
