With a background in Sociology and Computer Science, I am a computational social scientists interested in collective action. More specifically, my research is on the social group formation, dynamics, and cooperative work. Currently, I focus on the cooperative activities on social media in disruption: disasters arising from natural hazards, collective action around political crises, and community disruptions.
