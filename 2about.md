With a background in Sociology and Computer Science, I am a computational social scientist interested in collective action. More specifically, my research is on social group formation, dynamics, and cooperative work. Currently, I focus on the cooperative activities and the resulting social structures that emerge on social media in disruption events, such as disasters arising from natural hazards, collective action around political crises, and community disruptions.
