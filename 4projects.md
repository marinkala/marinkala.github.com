# Current Projects## Conversational Strategies and Status in Information-gathering during Natural Disaster
In this current project, we investigate how those geographically-vulnerable to the hazards of the 2017 hurricanes Harvey and Irma utilized various conversational strategies to garner attention and solicit replies from the official news and government accounts, as part of their information-gathering activities. We also investigate the role of social status and popularity in users' ability to get replies from the official accounts.

## Quantifying Attention-garnering Content on Social MediaIn this project, we focus on the role of attention on social media platforms, where the loudest voices often tend to dominate the discourse. This is especially salient in high-tempo, high-stakes environment of disaster, where choices of information sources can have real consequences. We utilize information-theoretic approaches to develop a method for quantifying the attention-garnering aspects of social media content in a principal, scalable way.

## Deep Learning for Opinion MiningWhile Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like topic modeling and sentiment analysis have been popular in social media analytics, their descriptive power over conversational dynamics is rather limited. For example, two people might discuss the same topic with the same general sentiment, but approach it from very different perspectives. In this project, we utilize deep learning approaches to develop methods for classifying social media content based on opinion, rather than topic or sentiment.

# Probabilistic Modeling
Utilizing ideas from the theory of random walks, we can model aspects of social activity as as stochastic processes. This can be a fruitful approach for understanding and modeling social dynamics, especially if the temporal or spatial dimensions of the activity are of interest.
