# Current Projects## Conversational Strategies and Status in Information-gathering during Natural Disaster
In this current project, we investigate how those geographically-vulnerable to the hazards of the 2017 hurricanes Harvey and Irma utilized various conversational strategies to garner attention and solicit replies from the official news and government accounts, as part of their information-gathering activities. We also investigate the role of social status and popularity in users' ability to get replies from the official accounts.

# Network Science
Network science is a powerful framework for understanding and modeling relational data. In the case of the social media data, network science allows us to both retain the context of individual activity (the links) and lift out more coarse-grained patterns in the network structure produced through social interaction.

# Natural Language Processing
Because most of the social media data is textual, I also work with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. I am also interested in applying more complex NLP methods to the dynamic social media data, such as the Mixed Membership Markov Model.

# Probabilistic Modeling
Utilizing ideas from the theory of random walks, we can model aspects of social activity as as stochastic processes. This can be a fruitful approach for understanding and modeling social dynamics, especially if the temporal or spatial dimensions of the activity are of interest.
