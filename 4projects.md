# Current Projects## Conversational Strategies and Status in Information-gathering during Natural Disaster
In this current project, we investigate how those geographically-vulnerable to the hazards of the 2017 hurricanes Harvey and Irma utilized various conversational strategies to garner attention and solicit replies from the official news and government accounts, as part of their information-gathering activities. We also investigate the role of social status and popularity in users' ability to get replies from the official accounts.

## Quantifying Attention-garnering Content on Social MediaIn this project, we focus on the role of attention on social media platforms, where the loudest voices often tend to dominate the discourse. This is especially salient in high-tempo, high-stakes environment of disaster, where choices of information sources can have real consequences. We utilize information-theoretic approaches to develop a method for quantifying the attention-garnering aspects of social media content in a principal, scalable way.

# Natural Language Processing
Because most of the social media data is textual, I also work with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. I am also interested in applying more complex NLP methods to the dynamic social media data, such as the Mixed Membership Markov Model.

# Probabilistic Modeling
Utilizing ideas from the theory of random walks, we can model aspects of social activity as as stochastic processes. This can be a fruitful approach for understanding and modeling social dynamics, especially if the temporal or spatial dimensions of the activity are of interest.
