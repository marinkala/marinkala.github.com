With a background in Sociology and Computer Science, I am a computational social scientist interested in collective action and sensemaking. More specifically, my research is on social group formation, dynamics, and cooperative work. Currently, I focus on the cooperative activities and the resulting large-scale social dynamics that emerge on social media in disruption events, such as disasters arising from natural hazards, collective action around political crises, and community disruptions.

More specifically, I use the lens of complex adaptive systems to model and understand group behavior on online platforms. The complex systems perspective allows me to trace and model how individual behaviors "add up" to the collective social dynamics. In this sense, methods of complexity science hold a promise of bridging the gap between the micro scale of the individual behavior and the macro scale of social dynamics.
