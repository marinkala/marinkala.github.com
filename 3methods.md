#Research Methods
Crisis informatics is a study of how people converge, propagate information, and cooperate around the tasks they deem important on social media in crisis. The socio-behavioral focus of crisis informatics necessitates that research methodology accounts for the social context of usersâ€™ activity.  On the other hand, the volume of the social media data requires the use of data science approaches, which currently can often decontextualize the social activity.  I strive to work with datasets and computational methods that also account for highly situated and contextual nature of the social activity in crisis.
